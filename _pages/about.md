I am a PhD candidate in [Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://cee.engineering.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, USA working with [David Rounce](https://www.cmu.edu/cee/cryotartans/index.html).

My research is focused on understanding current and future glacier mass changes through in-situ measurements, remote sensing, and modeling. Specifically, I am interested in:
- glacier field methods at high spatiotemporal resolution (e.g., GNSS, ice-penetrating radar, time-lapse systems)
- glacier reconstruction from historical photographs (e.g., structure-from-motion photogrammetry, image feature-tracking)
- glacier evolution model calibration with disparate datasets (e.g., glacier modeling)

Background
======
I grew up in Pittsburgh, PA before attending Brown University for my undergraduate studies and returning to Pittsburgh for graduate school. I came to Carnegie Mellon to study glaciology as it combined my background in engineering with my passion for the environment. Outside of research, I enjoy playing soccer, chess, hiking, and supporting the Pittsburgh sports teams.
