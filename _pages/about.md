I am a PhD candidate in [Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://cee.engineering.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, USA working with [David Rounce](https://www.cmu.edu/cee/cryotartans/index.html).

My research is focused on understanding current and future glacier mass changes through in-situ measurements, remote sensing, and modeling. Specifically, I am interested in:
- high spatiotemporal resolution glacier field methods
- glacier reconstruction from historical photographs
- glacier evolution model calibration with disparate datasets
