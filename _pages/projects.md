GNSS reflectometry from low-cost sensors for continuous in-situ contemporaneous glacier mass balance and flux divergence
======
*2022-2024*\
Recent advances in remote sensing have produced global glacier surface elevation change data. Parsing these elevation change signals into contributions from the climate (i.e. climatic mass balance) and glacier dynamics (i.e. flux divergence) is critical to enhancing our process-based understanding of glacier change. We evaluated three approaches for direct, continuous measurements of the climatic mass balance, flux divergence, and elevation change at a site on Gulkana Glacier in Alaska using low-cost global navigation satellite system (GNSS) sensors, GNSS interferometric reflectometry (GNSS-IR), banded ablation stakes with time-lapse cameras and combinations thereof. We showed that contemporaneous climatic mass balance, flux divergence, and elevation change can be obtained from a single GNSS system fixed atop an ablation stake. Thus, the data provide critical high-temporal resolution calibration and validation data for modeled and remote sensing-derived products alike, especially for efforts that seek to separate flux divergence signals from total elevation change. As one of the first studies leveraging GNSS-IR on a mountain glacier, we see potential in GNSS-IR for future in situ investigations of mountain glaciers, as it reduces the barrier for otherwise difficult simultaneous climatic mass balance and flux divergence measurements. While our study deployed systems during the ablation season, we see the potential for year-round observations on mountain glaciers in the future.\
